<h3>Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength</h3>
<h4> Objective: Understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools.</h4>
<h4>Tools: Online free password strength checkers (e.g., passwordmeter.com).</h4>
<p>Step 1. Create multiple passwords with varying complexity.</p>
  <br> Use uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, and length variations.</br>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Password</th>
    <th>Strength</th>
    <th>Example</th>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Letters</td>
    <td>Simple</td>
    <td>nikhila</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Letters,Numbers</td>
    <td>Medium</td>
    <td>Nikhila1995</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Letters,Numbers,Symbols</td>
    <td>Strong</td>
    <td>Nikhila@1995</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Length variations</td>
     <td>Excellent</td>
     <td>N!kh!l@_1995#</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br>Step 3.Test each password on password strength checker.</br>
 <br>Password 1- nikhila : The comlexity of the passwod - Very weak. score-8%. rating - Failure:Does not meet the minimum standards.</br>
<br> <img src="password1.jpg" alt="My Image" width="300" height="400"></br>
<br>Password 2- nikhila1995 : The comlexity of the passwod - Good. score-54%. rating -Advisory against employing bad practices</br>
<br> <img src="password2.jpg" alt="My Image" width="300" height="400"></br>
<br>Password 2- nikhila@1995 : The comlexity of the passwod - Strong. score-76%. rating -Sufficient:Meets minimum standards.</br>
<br> <img src="password3.jpg" alt="My Image" width="300" height="400"></br>
<br>Password 2- N!kh!l@_1995# : The comlexity of the passwod - Very Strong. score-100%. rating - Exceptional: Exceeds minimum standards.</br>
<br> <img src="password4.jpg" alt="My Image" width="300" height="400"></br>
<br>Step 5. Identify best practices for creating strong passwords.</br>
<ul>
      <li>Make it long: Aim for at least 12 characters, but 14 or more is even better. </li>
      <li>Be complex: Include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols</li>
      <li>Avoid personal information: Do not use your name, birthday, address, or pet's name. </li>
      <li>Don't reuse passwords: Use a different password for each account. If one account is compromised, others will remain secure. </li>
    </ul>
<br>Step 6. Research  common password attacks </br>
<ul>
      <li>Phishing : 
Tthe most common type of password attack, phishing involves a hacker pretending to be a trusted party and reaching out to their target requesting that they share personal login information. This often takes the form of a password-reset request or an account-confirmation email and can go as far as installing malicious code on the target’s machine when the provided link is accessed. </li>
      <li>Man-in-the-Middle Attack : 
In a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack, a hacker positions themself between a user and the system they are accessing. This form of wiretapping often capitalizes on unsecured Wi-Fi connections or unencrypted communications and allows the attacker to intercept or modify the data being communicated with the application.</li>
      <li>Brute Force Attack : 
Not every type of password attack involves subterfuge. A brute force attempts to gain access to restricted accounts and networks through trial and error, trying a large number of username and password variations.</li>
      <li>Keylogging : 
Keylogging is made possible by malware infection. A keylogger program is downloaded onto the target’s device (generally by masquerading as a legitimate download), where it can then record and share the user’s keystrokes — including their usernames and passwords — with the attacker. </li>
<li>Dictionary attack : A more targeted brute-force attack that uses a precompiled list of common words, phrases, and leaked passwords. These are very effective against users who choose simple, easy-to-guess passwords like "password123".</li>
    </ul>
<h4>Summary</h4>
Strong password creation relies on length, variety, and randomness. Simple passwords are easily broken using dictionary or brute-force attacks, while complex, long, and random passwords can take centuries to crack. The best defense is to use a password manager and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
